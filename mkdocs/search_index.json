If this feature has been requested already, there might also be some good discussion about how to get it done.\n\n Search the \nlist of open issues\n.\n\n Search the \ndRonin\n google group for any open discussion on the feature.\n\n\nIf you don't see any sign of the feature you want to add in any of those places, you should start a discussion thread in the \ndRonin\n google group describing your feature as clearly as possible.  This thread will be the place where other users and developers can help you work out some of the details about how best to implement the feature.  Once some of the details have been worked out, you can get started with the code.\n\n\nWhen adding your first feature to the code base, you might want to ask if one of the developers is available to mentor you through the process.  It's not that difficult but you might find it easier with a guide for the first time.\n\n\nIf you're stuck at any point, \nplease\n don't hesitate to ask for some help.\n\n\nSubmitting your code\n\n\nOnce you're done with your bug-fix or feature, the last step is submitting a pull request. This is as easy as \nclicking a button\n. Once your pull request is started, the continuous integration server (Jenkins) will automatically start to compile the new code, making sure that it builds for all targets. If everything is okay, then Jenkins will report that the build succeeded. If not, then Jenkins will report back with an error, visible on the Github pull request page, like shown:\n[[http://i.imgur.com/OOb5Zue.png|alt=Jenkins Results]]\n\n\nClicking the \"Details\" link will take you to the Jenkins build. Click \"Console Output\" on the left menu to see full build output. Tip: Ctrl+F and search for \"error\".\n\n\nAfter submitting your pull request, dRonin developers will be informed that a pull has been requested and they will review your code.  Please be patient during this stage since proper code reviews take time.  You should also be prepared to address any feedback that you get during the code review.  Once you've fixed any issues identified during review, your code will be merged into the upstream \nnext\n branch which is where the active development lands.\n\n\nPlease see these notes for [[Development-Coding-standards]] to make sure your new features are incorporated as quickly as possible.\n\n\nNotes for various parts of the code\n\n\n\n\n[[Math Libraries|math]]",

Before you get started, you'll want to find out if anyone else is already working on something similar (or identical!).  If this feature has been requested already, there might also be some good discussion about how to get it done.  Search the  list of open issues .  Search the  dRonin  google group for any open discussion on the feature.  If you don't see any sign of the feature you want to add in any of those places, you should start a discussion thread in the  dRonin  google group describing your feature as clearly as possible.  This thread will be the place where other users and developers can help you work out some of the details about how best to implement the feature.  Once some of the details have been worked out, you can get started with the code.  When adding your first feature to the code base, you might want to ask if one of the developers is available to mentor you through the process.  It's not that difficult but you might find it easier with a guide for the first time.  If you're stuck at any point,  please  don't hesitate to ask for some help.",

Once your pull request is started, the continuous integration server (Jenkins) will automatically start to compile the new code, making sure that it builds for all targets. If everything is okay, then Jenkins will report that the build succeeded. If not, then Jenkins will report back with an error, visible on the Github pull request page, like shown:\n[[http://i.imgur.com/OOb5Zue.png|alt=Jenkins Results]]  Clicking the \"Details\" link will take you to the Jenkins build. Click \"Console Output\" on the left menu to see full build output. Tip: Ctrl+F and search for \"error\".  After submitting your pull request, dRonin developers will be informed that a pull has been requested and they will review your code.  Please be patient during this stage since proper code reviews take time.  You should also be prepared to address any feedback that you get during the code review.  Once you've fixed any issues identified during review, your code will be merged into the upstream  next  branch which is where the active development lands.  Please see these notes for [[Development-Coding-standards]] to make sure your new features are incorporated as quickly as possible.",
