# Create a New UAVObjects

UAVObjects use code that is dynamically generated by the uavobjectgenerator. The specification for a UAVObject is an XML file placed in `shared/uavobjectdefinition`. There a few key steps to creating a new UAVObjects:

1. place the XML file in `shared/uavobjectdefinition`
1. add the object in your `flight/targets/<targetname>/fw/UAVObject.inc` file
1. add the object in `ground/gcs/src/plugins/uavobjects/uavobjects.pro` (make sure to add it both in the headers and source section)
1. in your module that uses it include the file `#include "<objectname.h>"` and then initialize it `ObjectNameInitialize()` in the ModuleInitialize section of the code
