## Lab Workbench

What's on the workbench:

* PC with Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit, Windows 7
* Power supply: Rigol DP832 Triple Output 195 Watt, [Manual](https://assets.tequipment.net/assets/1/26/Rigol_DP800_UserGuide.pdf) 
* Oscilloscope: Rigol DS4204 (350M bandwidth, UART/I2C/SPI/CAN decoding), [Manual](https://assets.tequipment.net/assets/1/26/Documents/Rigol/DS4054/ds4054_doc_11.pdf)
* Multimeter: Fluke 117, [Manual](http://assets.fluke.com/manuals/114_____umeng0100.pdf)
* Soldering station: Hakko FX888D with tips (T18-D16, T18-D32, T18-C2), [Manual](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Tools/fx888d.pdf)
* Soldering accessories:
    * **Lead-free** solder, flux, solder wick
    * Smoke absorber: Hakko FA-400
    * Vise: Panavise 209
    * Tweezer set
    * Wire cutter and wire stripper
    * Heat gun and heat shrink tubes

### General rules

* Do not take any item away from the workbench and always use the equipment on this workbench.
* Clean up the workbench after each use and put all items back to place.

### How to solder

There are a lot of good tutorials on soldering available from the Internet. 

* [How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering - Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering)
* [How to solder correctly - RCTECH](http://www.rctech.net/forum/radio-electronics/336870-how-solder-correctly-not-so-brief-lesson.html) (long but highly recommended)
* More on YouTube

Summary

* Wet the sponge before use. It should be sufficient for most the tip cleanning work. In other cases, use the cleaning wire.
* For most through hole soldering, 610~625 F temperature should be sufficient. Consider using a larger tip if you find the solder not flowing well even with a higher temperature, for example when you're soldering 12 AWG wires to a motor. 
* Before soldering, clean and add a small amount of solder to the tip for better heat transfer.
* Clean the soldering surface and use flux when necessary. 
* Heat the pad & component lead with iron tip and feed the solder to the joint. Don't try to attach solder to the tip and then transfer the solder from the tip to the joint. (Read the above articles if you are not clear what this means.)
* Don't leave the soldring iron on for a long time, for example when you need to spend 10+ minutes to work on something else. Hot iron tip will oxidize more quickly, which shortens the life of the tip. 
* Clean and tin the tip (leave a blob of solder on the tip) after you finish the soldering work.
* **BE CAREFUL NOT TO MELT THE OSCILLOOSCOPE PROBES OR ANY OTHER ITEMS BY ACCIDENT!**

### How to use the power supply

* Set the voltage and current properly BEFORE enabling the channel. Otherwise you may damage your circuit with improper power input.
* Refer to manual for more details
